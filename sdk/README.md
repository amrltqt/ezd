The SDK provide a client validation for the EZD API.
The validation follows the same rules as the API.

The objective for the client is to help developers creating their own extended client with all the objects types and methods available in the API.

## Usage

```python
from ezd import EZDClient

client = EZDClient("http://localhost:8611")
```
